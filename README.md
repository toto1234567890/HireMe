# HireMe

This an exibition of some parts of my work done on spare time...
this is a "starting" point of a personal project, which should ended (maybe) as a trading "plateform".


#Â This project is/will be split in 5 main parts : 
  - a "common" part which contains the "core part" for every other parts
  - a "trading" part which make trades (operational part)
  - an "analyst" part which will make different kind of analysis (technical, statistical, fundamental analysis...)
  - a "scrapy" part which will scrap different kind of data around the web
  - a "backtesting" part which should be able to make tests with "portfolio rebalancing"
    
The common parts are mostly finished, the others have been started...                                                                              
The project rely on asyncio, flask, fastAPI, multiprocess, threads, sockets, socket-io, jupyter-lab, TA-lib, websocket, django... 
(I have added the requirements.txt of the python virtual environment)
