# HireMe

<br>
This an exibition of some parts of my work done on spare time...
this is a "starting" point of a personal project, which should ended (maybe) as a trading "plateform".

<br>
#Â This project is/will be split in 5 main parts : 
  - a "common" part which contains the "core part" for every other parts
  - a "trading" part which make trades (operational part)
  - an "analyst" part which will make different kind of analysis (technical, statistical, fundamental analysis...)
  - a "scrapy" part which will scrap different kind of data around the web
  - a "backtesting" part which should be able to make tests with "portfolio rebalancing"

<br>
The common part is mostly finished, the others have been started...                                                                              
The project rely on asyncio, flask, fastAPI, multiprocess, threads, sockets, socket-io, jupyter-lab, TA-lib, websocket, django... 
(I have added the requirements.txt of the python virtual environment)

<br>

<h4>This repo contains only (and almost) all the files of the "common" part </h4>

And many others things... (fundamental analysis on stocks, websockets..., sometime integrated, sometimes only snippets or not linked scripts)

to be continued...
