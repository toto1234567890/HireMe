# HireMe

<br>
This is an exemple of some personal work done on my spare time, with the most recent addition using a chatGPT assistant. <br>
This is the starting point of a personal project which should finally become my trading plateform.
<br><br>
This project is/will be split in 5 main components :<br>
       - "common" shares the "core part" for all other parts <br>
       - "trading" make trades (operational part) <br>
       - "analyst" makes different types of analysis (technical, statistical, fundamental analysis...) <br>
       - "scrapy" scraps different data sources on the web <br>
       - "backtesting" makes tests with "portfolio rebalancing" <br>

<br>
The "common" part is finished, the others are still under construction.<br>                                                                             
The project relies on Python's asyncio, flask, fastAPI, multiprocess, threads, sockets, socket-io, jupyter-lab, TA-lib, websocket, django <br>
(I have added the requirements.txt of the python virtual environment).

<br>

<h4>This current repo contains almost all  files of the "common" component </h4>

![FastAPI2](fastAPI2.png)



<br>
And some other things... (fundamental analysis on stocks, websockets, pseudo-arbitrage..., sometime integrated, sometime only snippets or not linked scripts)<br><br>

Will be continued...<br>
Thank you for taking times to take a look at my "draft" coding files !<br>
