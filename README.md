# HireMe

<br>
This is an exibition of some parts of my personal work done on my spare time... (with recently, chatGPT as assistant !) <br>
This is the "starting" point of a personal project, which should ended (maybe) as my trading "plateform".
<br><br>
This project is/will be split in 5 main parts :<br>
       - a "common" part which contains the "core part" for every other parts <br>
       - a "trading" part which make trades (operational part) <br>
       - an "analyst" part which will make different kind of analysis (technical, statistical, fundamental analysis...) <br>
       - a "scrapy" part which will scrap different kind of data around the web <br>
       - a "backtesting" part which should be able to make tests with "portfolio rebalancing" <br>

<br>
The common part is mostly finished, the others have been started... <br>                                                                             
The project rely on asyncio, flask, fastAPI, multiprocess, threads, sockets, socket-io, jupyter-lab, TA-lib, websocket, django... <br>
(I have added the requirements.txt of the python virtual environment)

<br>

<h4>This repo contains only, and almost all the files of the "common" part </h4>

<br>
And many others things... (fundamental analysis on stocks, websockets, pseudo-arbitrage..., sometime integrated, sometime only snippets or not linked scripts)<br><br>

Will be continued...<br>
Thank you for taking times to take a look at my "draft" coding files !<br>
